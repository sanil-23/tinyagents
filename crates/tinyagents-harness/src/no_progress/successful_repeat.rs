//! Successful-repeat progress detection.
//!
//! [`NoProgressTracker`] handles failing tool calls, but deliberately resets on
//! success. That leaves a second loop shape undetected: a model can repeatedly
//! emit the same response and successfully invoke the same no-op tool call.
//! This tracker owns the provider- and product-neutral streak accounting for
//! those loops; a harness middleware remains responsible for building canonical
//! signatures and deciding which polling tools are exempt.
//!
//! The streaks only see back-to-back repeats. A model that cycles through
//! several successful calls (A, B, A, B, ...) changes the signature every step
//! and never trips them, so the tracker also keeps a run-wide ledger of
//! `(call, result)` recurrences fed by
//! [`SuccessfulRepeatTracker::record_call_outcome`].
