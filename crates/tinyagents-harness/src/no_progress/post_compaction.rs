//! Post-compaction loop guard.
//!
//! Context compaction can erase the evidence that a run was looping: the model
//! wakes up with a summary, repeats the call it was stuck on, gets the same
//! result and is back in the loop, with the repeat ledger cleared. This guard
//! remembers the last few `(call, result)` pairs that were *already repeating*
//! (recurred at least [`REPEATING_AT`] times) right before a compaction. For a
//! short window of calls after it, a call that repeats one of those pairs is
//! flagged so the host can warn the model.
//!
//! It is warning-only. Re-reading content a compaction evicted is correct
//! behaviour, so a single repeat is never blocked, and a pair that was not
//! repeating before the compaction is not remembered at all.
